# ToyADMOSTinyAutoencoder
A tiny convolutional autoencoder for anomaly detection in the ToyADMOS dataset. The model is small enough to fit on an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense).

This repository contains four files: 
* A .gitignore file that lists a bunch of acessory files that shouldn't be committed to this online repository.
* This README file.
* A python script which trains and tests the tiny convolutional autoencoder. Use the "-h" option for usage information.
* A python script to process the results generated by the tiny convolutional autoencoder.
